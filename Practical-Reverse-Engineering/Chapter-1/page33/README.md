1. - [x] Repeat the walk-through by yourself. Draw the stack layout, including parameters and local variables.


2. - [x] In the example walk-through, we did a nearly one-to-one translation of the assembly code to C. As an exercise,re-decompile this whole function so that it looks more natural.What can you say about the developer's skill level/experience? Explain your reasons. Can you do a better job?


3. - [ ] In some of the assembly listings, the function name has a @ prefix followed by a number. Explain when and why this decoration exists.


4. - [x] Implement the following functions in x86 assembly: strlen, strchr, memcpy, memset, strcmp, strset.


5. - [ ] Decompile the following kernel routines in Windows:

     - [x] KeInitializeDpc
     - [x] KeInitializeApc
     - [ ] ObFastDereferenceObject (and explain its calling convention)
     - [ ] KeInitializeQueue
     - [ ] KxWaitForLockChainValid
     - [ ] KeReadyThread
     - [x] KiInitializeTSS
     - [ ] RtlValidateUnicodeString
